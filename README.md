This is a backend Python web server that utilizes Javascript, CSS, and HTML for the frontend. This was very simply made and most of the code was originally from Python basics, although I made a few adjustments that I thought would be applicable.
This server isn't the fastest, and if you are looking for a server that is fast then I would recommend cherrypy.

## Hosting the server locally
```shell
python serv.py
```
### Hostname 
```shell
localhost:6060
```

#### Check out Cherrypy:
